# Installing Cool

Cool release artifacts are promoted from a validated release candidate. A
promoted release directory contains the platform tarball, `release.json`,
`SHA256SUMS`, release notes, and a copy of `install.sh`.

## Local Artifact

Use this path when testing a release before uploading it:

```bash
bash install.sh \
  --from dist/releases/1.1.0/cool-1.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz \
  --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

The installer extracts the payload under `$HOME/.local/lib/cool/` and symlinks
`cool` into `$HOME/.local/bin/cool`.

## Hosted Release

After assets are uploaded to a GitHub release, install by version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codenz92/cool-lang/master/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --version 1.1.0 --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

The default download base is:

```text
https://github.com/codenz92/cool-lang/releases/download
```

Override it for mirrors or internal channels:

```bash
bash install.sh --version 1.1.0 --base-url https://example.invalid/cool/releases/download
```

Windows installs default to the `.zip` asset for the selected Windows platform.
macOS and Linux installs default to `.tar.gz` assets. Override the platform when
installing a non-host asset:

```bash
bash install.sh --version 1.1.0 --platform linux-x86_64
```

## Checksum Verification

Every promoted release writes `SHA256SUMS`. Verify the archive before installing
or pass the expected archive hash to the installer:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
bash install.sh \
  --from cool-1.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz \
  --verify-sha256 "<archive-sha256>"
```

You can also let the installer verify the archive through release metadata:

```bash
bash install.sh \
  --from cool-1.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz \
  --checksums SHA256SUMS
```

For signed releases, verify the detached `SHA256SUMS.sig` signature before the
archive is installed:

```bash
bash install.sh \
  --from cool-1.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz \
  --checksums SHA256SUMS \
  --checksums-signature SHA256SUMS.sig \
  --verify-key release-signing-public.pem
```

Hosted installs can infer `SHA256SUMS` from the release URL:

```bash
bash install.sh --version 1.1.0 --verify-metadata
```

Public releases are also checked from the hosted download URLs with
`scripts/verify_hosted_release.sh`. See `docs/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md` for the
release-day flow and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` for the supported platform list.

## Smoke Test

By default the installer runs:

```bash
cool help
```

Use `--no-smoke` only when installing into an environment where the binary cannot
be executed during setup.
