# Release Runbook

This runbook is the operator checklist for shipping a public Cool release. It
assumes the version in `Cargo.toml` is final and the release branch is clean.

## Roles And Inputs

- Release owner: one person owns the checklist and final publish decision.
- Version: semantic version without the leading `v`, for example `1.0.0`.
- Tag: `v<version>`.
- Signing key: optional OpenSSL private key exposed to CI as `COOL_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_B64`.
- Required public platforms: `linux-x86_64`, `macos-x86_64`, `macos-arm64`, `windows-x86_64`.

## Local Preflight

Run the release gate from a clean tree:

```bash
bash scripts/release_gate.sh
```

The release gate includes the Phase 26 conformance suite. To capture a separate
compatibility report for release evidence, run:

```bash
bash scripts/conformance_suite.sh \
  --report dist/validation/1.0.0/conformance-validation.json
```

Build and promote a local host candidate when you need a fast final sanity
check before using the full matrix:

```bash
bash scripts/release_candidate.sh --require-clean --version 1.0.0
bash scripts/promote_release.sh --version 1.0.0
bash scripts/package_channels.sh generate --version 1.0.0
bash scripts/validate_release.sh \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --require-trust \
  --require-channels \
  --install-smoke
```

For a synthetic four-platform packaging check from the host artifact:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke_matrix_release.sh --version 1.0.0
```

## Matrix Release

Use the `Release Matrix` workflow for public releases. It builds the four public
platforms, assembles one multi-platform release directory, generates trust
metadata, generates package-channel files, validates everything, and optionally
publishes the GitHub Release.

Manual dispatch inputs:

- `version`: release version without `v`.
- `publish`: set to `true` only when the matrix validation has passed.
- `draft`: keep `true` for the first upload unless the release is already approved.

Tag push flow:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Tag pushes publish a non-draft release through the workflow. Use manual dispatch
with a draft when you want a final human review before public promotion.

## Published Release Verification

After the GitHub Release is public, run hosted verification against the uploaded
assets instead of local `dist/` files:

```bash
bash scripts/verify_hosted_release.sh \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --platform multi \
  --require-trust \
  --check-channel-archive \
  --require-platform linux-x86_64 \
  --require-platform macos-x86_64 \
  --require-platform macos-arm64 \
  --require-platform windows-x86_64 \
  --install-smoke \
  --install-smoke-platform linux-x86_64 \
  --report dist/hosted-validation/1.0.0/hosted-release-validation.json
```

The `Hosted Release Verify` workflow runs the same check on `release.published`
events and can also be dispatched manually for mirrors or rechecks.

## Rollback

If hosted verification fails before announcement:

1. Convert the release back to draft, or delete the broken release if it cannot
   be repaired in place.
2. Do not move a public tag silently. If a tag was published with broken assets,
   create a patch release unless the release has not been consumed.
3. Fix the issue on `master`, rebuild the matrix, and rerun hosted verification.
4. Record the failed asset, failing verification command, and replacement release
   in a `Release hotfix` issue.

If a package-channel file is wrong but archives are correct, regenerate channels,
upload the replacement channel archive, and rerun hosted verification with
`--check-channel-archive`.

## Hotfix Release

For a code hotfix:

```bash
bash scripts/release_gate.sh
bash scripts/release_candidate.sh --require-clean --version 1.0.1
```

Then use the same matrix, trust, package-channel, and hosted verification steps
as a normal release. The hotfix issue should link the broken release, the fixed
release, and the verification report.

## Final Record

Before closing the release checklist, record:

- GitHub Release URL.
- `release-validation.json` workflow artifact.
- `conformance-validation.json` or `conformance-suite.json` workflow artifact.
- `hosted-release-validation.json` workflow artifact.
- Package-channel archive name and hash.
- Any manual deviations from this runbook.
